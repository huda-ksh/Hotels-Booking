This application represents simple online hotels reservation web site , built using .net frame work and c# programming language.

The web site consumes this url “https://offersvc.expedia.com/offers/v2/getOffers?scenario=deal-finder&page=foo&uid=foo&productType=Hotel”
that returns a result containing hotels information and offers for booking process in appealing manner.

The process i followed for building this application is the following:

1-Designing home page that contains search criteria that filters the hotels and returns list of hotels booking offers with dummy data.
2-Creating domain objects that represents the data objects returned from the json result .
3-Creating functionality for consuming the api and returning result.
4-Creating functionaity for filling domain  objects with data returned from the api filtered by search parameteres entered by end user.
5-Return this data in a readable manner for the end user in the home page .

What i have learned from this exersize is how to create a website from scratch and taking in consideration making my code readable,maintinable,documented 
and archtictured in a way to get best performance and in the same time attractive and simple user experience.

I have around 4 years experience in building projects with .net framework and c# language, Html5,jquery,json,and i also worked with api’s and restful services, and wcf.
